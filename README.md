CreateProcess() Windows API Command-Line Utility
================================================

A complete, robust command-line utility to construct highly customized calls to the CreateProcess() Windows API to start new processes.  Released under a MIT or LGPL license.

This project is intended primarily for use from batch files (.bat) to execute other programs.  If it can be done with CreateProcess(), it can be done with this command-line program.

Why would you need this?  One use-case would be for programs that don't play nice even with the 'start' command.  For example, Apache 'httpd.exe' hangs the command-line even with 'start /B /MIN' but running this program with `/f=DETACHED_PROCESS` and Apache starts completely in the background.  I developed this primarily for Apache (way overkill for one feature), but I've had need for this program for other things on many different occasions.

GitHub is a perfect fit for this sort of project.  The latest source and binaries reside here, so updating is a matter of running a 'git pull'.  You can also use it as a submodule in your own Git project.  If you know of any changes that need to be made, submit a pull request so that everyone benefits.

Features
--------

* Command-line action!
* Verbose mode tells you exactly how CreateProcess() will be called.  No more guessing!
* Can redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to TCP/IP sockets.  Avoid blocking on anonymous pipes or storing output in files!
* Pre-built binaries using Visual Studio (statically linked C++ runtime, minimal file size of ~107K, direct Win32 API calls).
* Console and Windows subsystem variants.
* Unicode support.
* Offers almost everything CreateProcess() offers plus a couple of nice extras (e.g. output the process ID to a file).
* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.

Useful Information
------------------

Running the command by itself will display the options, but it never hurts to have a complete rundown of the options:

```
Syntax:  createprocess.exe [options] EXEToRun [arguments]

Options:
        /v
        Verbose mode.

        /w[=Milliseconds]
        Waits for the process to complete before exiting.
        The default behavior is to return immediately.
        If Milliseconds is specified, the number of milliseconds to wait.
        Return code, if any, is returned to caller.

        /pid=File
        Writes the process ID to the specified file.

        /term
        Used with /w=Milliseconds.
        Terminates the process when the wait time is up.

        /f=PriorityClass
                Sets the priority class of the new process.

                When this option is empty, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is used.
                When this option is 'socket', the /socket IP and port are used.
                When this option is not specified, the current stdin is used.

                Sets the STARTUPINFO.hStdError handle for the new process.
                When this option is empty, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is used.
                When this option is 'stdout', the value of stdout is used.
                When this option is 'socket', the /socket IP and port are used.
                When this option is not specified, the current stderr is used.
```

That's pretty nifty.  But what is even more impressive is the verbose output `/v` option that shows exactly how CreateProcess() will be called.  I'll let you take that for a spin though.

Even the most hardcore command-line enthusiast should be drooling right now.  Be sure to check out the source code.

Windows Subsystem Variant
-------------------------

While `createprocess.exe` is intended for use with console apps, `createprocess-win.exe` is intended for detached console and GUI applications.  Starting `createprocess.exe` in certain situations will briefly flash a console window before starting the target process.  Calling `createprocess-win.exe` instead will no longer show the console window.

Why not just use `createprocess-win.exe`?  Since `createprocess-win.exe` starts as a Windows GUI application, there is the tendency for it to be run in the background and may not behave as expected with various handles.  The software is a little bit trickier to work with as a result.  It's also a few KB larger than `createprocess.exe`.

There is one additional option specifically for `createprocess-win.exe` called `/attach` which attempts to attach to the console of the parent process (if any) and will also reset the standard handles.  The `/attach` option, if used, should generally be specified before other options.

TCP/IP Notes
------------

The TCP/IP socket options represent a security risk so take proper precautions.  Example usage can be seen in the [ProcessHelper class](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-misc/blob/master/support/process_helper.php).

In addition, passing SOCKET handles to the target process causes problems.  Sometimes the target process works just fine and sometimes it doesn't.  To deal with this issue, up to three threads are started, one for each of the standard handles.  Each thread routes data between its socket handle and an associated anonymous pipe of the started process.  As a consequence of using the TCP/IP socket option, the `/w` option is always set so that the started process is waited on (i.e. so the threads can transfer data).  This doesn't exactly matter as the `/w` option would be used anyway by the caller when passing socket options.
